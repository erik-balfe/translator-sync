# Development Plan for Fluent Interpreter

This document outlines the current state, proposed enhancements, and the roadmap for future improvements to the Fluent Interpreter project.

## 1. Current State

- **Purpose:**
  A CLI tool for synchronizing Fluent (FTL) translation files, ensuring that all translation files match the keys from the primary language file.

- **Key Functionalities:**
  - Validation of the provided directory and existence of the main language file.
  - Reading and parsing of FTL files using the Fluent syntax.
  - Updating non-primary language files:
    - Reusing existing translations.
    - Automatically translating missing keys using a mock translation service.
    - Removing keys not present in the primary file.
  - Integration tests covering scenarios like valid sync, missing files, malformed FTL, extra keys, and handling of non-FTL files.

## 2. Proposed Documentation Enhancements

- **README Improvements:**

  - Clear project overview, installation, usage, and troubleshooting sections.
  - Explanation of configuration and how to modify it.
  - Contribution guidelines with a link to the development plan for further details.

- **Developer Guide:**
  - A separate document (such as this one) detailing the inner workings of the application.
  - Architecture overview, code structure, and module responsibilities.
  - Testing strategy and instructions for adding new tests.

## 3. Proposed Feature Improvements & Fixes

- **Error Reporting:**

  - Enhance the error messages to make troubleshooting easier.
  - Differentiate between file system errors, parsing errors, and translation service errors.

- **Configuration Flexibility:**

  - Expand the configuration options (e.g., allow custom primary language and enable CLI flag options such as --dry-run or --verbose).

- **Translator Service:**

  - While the current implementation uses a mock translation service, outline a plan to integrate an actual translation API.
  - Document the process to swap out the mock service for a production-ready one.

- **CLI Options:**

  - Introduce additional flags (e.g., --dry-run, --verbose, --config) to improve CLI usability.

- **Robust File Handling:**
  - Add more robust file I/O error handling and possibly a rollback mechanism for file writes.

## 4. Implementation Roadmap

1. **Documentation Updates:**

   - Revise the README with detailed sections on installation, usage, troubleshooting, and contribution.
   - Create more comprehensive inline documentation within the code using JSDoc comments.
   - Finalize and maintain this Development Plan document.

2. **Error and Logging Improvements:**

   - Review and update error handling across the CLI.
   - Add more actionable log messages (both in normal and verbose modes).

3. **Configuration Enhancements:**

   - Update [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) to accept additional parameters.
   - Document the available configuration options.

4. **Feature Enhancements:**

   - Plan and implement additional CLI flags for improved user experience.
   - Investigate and prototype a real translation service integration as an alternative to the mock service.

5. **Testing and Quality Assurance:**

   - Expand the test suite with additional edge case scenarios.
   - Continuously review test feedback and logs to ensure smooth execution.

6. **Developer Onboarding:**
   - Create a dedicated contributor guide to help new developers understand the project architecture and development practices.
   - Keep the Development Plan up-to-date with progress and future ideas.

## 5. Conclusion

This plan outlines both immediate improvements and longer-term goals to enhance functionality, stability, and ease of maintenance. Regular reviews and contributions from the community will help evolve the project into a robust translation synchronization tool.
