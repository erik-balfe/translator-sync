# ADR-001: Choose Bun as Runtime

## Status
**Accepted** - 2025-01-XX

## Context
TranslatorSync is a CLI tool that needs to:
- Start quickly for good user experience
- Handle file I/O efficiently
- Support TypeScript natively
- Minimize dependencies and complexity
- Provide good developer experience

We evaluated three main runtime options:
1. **Node.js** with TypeScript compilation
2. **Deno** with native TypeScript support
3. **Bun** with native TypeScript support

## Decision
We chose **Bun** as the runtime for TranslatorSync.

## Rationale

### Performance Benefits
- **Fast startup**: Bun starts significantly faster than Node.js
- **Optimized file I/O**: Native file APIs are optimized for CLI tools
- **Built-in bundling**: No need for separate build tools
- **Memory efficiency**: Lower memory footprint for CLI operations

### Developer Experience
- **Native TypeScript**: No compilation step required
- **Built-in test runner**: No need for Jest or other test frameworks  
- **Package manager**: Built-in package management
- **Hot reloading**: Fast development iteration

### Ecosystem Considerations
- **NPM compatibility**: Can use existing NPM packages
- **Growing ecosystem**: Active development and community
- **Production ready**: Used by major projects
- **Tooling support**: Good IDE integration

## Alternatives Considered

### Node.js + TypeScript
**Pros**:
- Mature ecosystem
- Extensive tooling
- Wide community support

**Cons**:
- Requires compilation step
- Slower startup times
- More complex build setup
- Additional dependencies (ts-node, build tools)

### Deno
**Pros**:
- Native TypeScript support
- Built-in formatter and linter
- Security-first design
- Standard library

**Cons**:
- Smaller ecosystem
- Different module resolution
- Less tooling for CLI development
- Node.js compatibility issues

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Faster development**: No build step needed
- **Better UX**: Quick CLI startup
- **Simpler setup**: Fewer tools and configuration
- **Modern features**: Latest JavaScript/TypeScript features
- **Performance**: Optimized for our use case

### Negative
- **Newer ecosystem**: Less mature than Node.js
- **Tool compatibility**: Some tools may not support Bun yet
- **Learning curve**: Team needs to learn Bun-specific APIs
- **Risk**: Newer project with potential breaking changes

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Compatibility layer**: Use Node.js-compatible APIs where possible
- **Fallback plan**: Code can be adapted to Node.js if needed
- **Version pinning**: Pin Bun version to avoid breaking changes
- **Testing**: Extensive testing to catch Bun-specific issues

## Implementation Notes

### File I/O
```typescript
// Use Bun's optimized file APIs
const content = await Bun.file(filePath).text();
await Bun.write(filePath, content);
```

### Package Management
```bash
# Use Bun's package manager
bun install
bun add <package>
bun run <script>
```

### Testing
```bash
# Use Bun's built-in test runner
bun test
```

## Monitoring
We will monitor:
- **Performance metrics**: Startup time, file processing speed
- **Ecosystem evolution**: New Bun features and improvements
- **Community adoption**: Package compatibility and support
- **Issue tracking**: Bun-specific bugs or limitations

## Review Date
This decision should be reviewed in **6 months (July 2025)** to assess:
- Bun's ecosystem maturity
- Performance benefits realized
- Any blocking issues encountered
- Community and tooling support evolution
