# v0.2.0 - June 3, 2025

> **Summary**: Major code quality improvements with intelligent context system and comprehensive CI/CD pipeline

## üéØ Highlights

- **Intelligent Context System**: AI-powered project description refinement for better translation quality
- **Comprehensive CI/CD**: Multi-platform testing, security scanning, and automated quality checks
- **API Key Security**: Robust security measures to prevent accidental key exposure

## ‚ú® New Features

- **Context Extraction Service**: LLM-driven analysis of project descriptions to improve translation context
- **Enhanced Translator**: Automatic context injection into translation requests for better results
- **DeepSeek Provider**: Cost-effective translation service integration with full API support
- **Multi-platform Testing**: CI/CD pipeline now tests on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Security Scanning**: Automated detection of hardcoded API keys in CI/CD pipeline

## üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fix regex for nested braces in JSON parser (React i18next variables)
- Fix Windows-specific test failure in fileManager relative path handling
- Fix formatting issues in test files
- Fix Windows PowerShell compatibility in CI (now uses bash shell)
- Update test expectations for context extractor heuristic evaluation

## üîß Improvements

- Enhanced JSON parser to handle complex nested variable structures
- Improved error handling in translation services with graceful fallbacks
- Better cost calculation system supporting multiple usage stat formats
- Skip integration tests in CI when API keys not available (security best practice)
- Only run unit tests for coverage checks (faster CI pipeline)
- Remove Codecov dependency (was causing CI failures)

## üèóÔ∏è Development

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Comprehensive 6-job pipeline with lint, test, type-check, build, security, and coverage
- **Test Coverage**: 50% minimum threshold enforcement with detailed reporting
- **Code Quality**: Biome.js integration for consistent linting and formatting
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript configuration with no `any` types allowed
- **Dependency Injection**: Improved testability with injectable services

## üìö Documentation

- **Security Guidelines**: Comprehensive API key security documentation
- **Release System**: Organized release notes structure for better maintenance
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Optional security scanning before commits
- **Contributing Guidelines**: Updated with security requirements and workflow
- **.env.example**: Template for required environment variables

## üîê Security

- **API Key Security Rules**: Added to CLAUDE.md to prevent AI assistant exposure
- **Security-check Script**: Automated scanning for potential API key exposure
- **Enhanced CI Scanning**: Multiple pattern detection for various API key formats
- **Pre-commit Hook**: Optional security scanning before commits
- **Environment Variable Guidelines**: Clear separation of secrets from code

## üíî Breaking Changes

- None - all changes are backward compatible

## üì¶ Dependencies

- **@opentelemetry/\***: Updated to latest versions for better observability
- **openai**: Updated to v4.103.0 for latest API features
- **@biomejs/biome**: Added v1.9.4 for unified linting and formatting

## Migration Guide

No migration required - all changes are backward compatible. Existing `.env` files and configurations will continue to work.

### Recommended Actions

1. **Security**: Run `bun run security-check` to scan for any hardcoded API keys
2. **Pre-commit Hook**: Consider installing the optional pre-commit hook:
   ```bash
   cp scripts/pre-commit-hook.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
   chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
   ```
3. **Environment**: Update your `.env` file using `.env.example` as reference

## Test Results

- **Unit Tests**: 193 tests passing across 10 test files
- **Integration Tests**: Comprehensive API testing with real services
- **Multi-platform**: Tests verified on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Coverage**: Exceeds 50% threshold requirement
